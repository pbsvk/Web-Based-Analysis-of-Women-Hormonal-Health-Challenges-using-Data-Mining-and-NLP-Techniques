Okay PCOS People. I just had an appointment with a PCOS specialist and wanted to share.,"My mom found a pcos clinic and recommended that I get an appointment to just check it out and it was absolutely incredible. I wanted to share the tips and information the nurse gave me because I found it so helpful.

First thing, she said we are more likely for heart disease, liver disease, and diabetes. Its best to avoid excessive caffeine, alcohol and unhealthy diets. She said the best diet for PCOS is the Mediterranean diet. She said 4-5 days a week you should alternate weight training and 30-45 minutes of cardio.

She also said that we born with PCOS and will have it forever. Its not something that anyone did wrong to get PCOS, you are born that way. 

Progretin-only birth control such as Slynd or Nexplanon are great for helping with the hyper-androgenism symptoms. (I have factor V leiden and she said this is perfectly safe for factor V patients)

She said thats its important for people with PCOS to get annual blood tests to check their A1C, liver enzymes, and lipids. 

I think thats all the info I can remember but I highly recommend finding a PCOS specialist because she went over all my charts and explained how they are connected to my PCOS and I will be meeting with her again in 3 months after all the testing she is sending me for and starting spironolactone and progestin only pills.",871.0,[],,,,neutral,"Maintain a balanced lifestyle with regular exercise, sleep, and a healthy diet."

Edit: 38f being told I have PCOS. Been on BC for 20+ years. Have had ovarian cysts before and cystic acne. 

Have been off pill for 1.5 months. Symptoms like raging mood swings, OILY skin/hair (oily face, chest and back but everything else is dry AF). Itchy AF. Really weird periods.

Do you have a 'pcos body'?,"Other than the more masculine fat distribution, which to my impression is incredibly common, and also have it myself;
I am talking about developing a body that's less traditionally feminine, mostly in terms of proportions.

For example, I have wide shoulders and ribcage and narrow hips, which makes me have less 'harmonious' proportions that I am not a fan of. In short, apart from having breasts there is pretty much nothing about my body that represant the typical female form.

I also never saw a representation of anyone in some kind of media that has a similar body type to mine.

How about you? Do you think you have anything that notably, likely has to do with PCOS? Or any other kind of hormonal disorder, if that's a thing.
It would be interesting to know how much range if variation there is and what it might look like. 
If you have a prerfectly 'normal' body type, it would be interesting to know that as well, because I am pretty sure I've never met someone with PCOS who doesn't have some of the just mentioned characteristics.",380.0,[],,,,neutral,"Maintain a balanced lifestyle with regular exercise, sleep, and a healthy diet."

Lazy girl pcos weight loss hacks?,"I’ve been collecting them over this past year. Feel free to add. Please note I have really bad depression and that’s a big reason why I just want to do the bare minimum. I understand it means longer time before I see results. Also my lazy may not look like your lazy. 

1. Snack Pack (pumpkin seeds, clementines, carrots, walnuts, cheese stick— I just toss these in my bag and it helps when i get home and feel like im going to pass out if i don’t eat something right away. There’s variety and I pick and choose what I’m craving) 

2. Permanently deleted my Uber Eats & Doordash (this also meant losing my Uber account but I switched to Lyft and if I want takeout I have to get it myself)

3. Instead of a gym membership I just pay more for a building with a gym (I’ll walk on the treadmill while I wait for my laundry to finish, I’m a big walker and this comes in handy during the winter)  

4. Live in a walkable city (self-explanatory but I do 5-10k steps a day usually, in the suburbs I walked loops in my neighborhood but I work remote so I like time away from my desk to  explore new places) 

5. Keep all my vitamins & meds (inositol, magnesium, zinc, coq10, berberine) visible at all times otherwise I forget they exist bc adhd

6. ClassPass to explore different classes and picking what I like the most (1 hot yoga class doubles as a sauna for me, 1 matt pilates) and have go to home workouts 

7. Pick 3 ways to enjoy eggs for when you get the ick (pesto from Trader Joe’s, scrambled with cottage cheese, sunny side up)

8. I stopped eating avacados (the quality of the ones near me are bad and it’s not unhealthy by any means it’s just an easier way for me to reduce calories, I don’t have a strong enough mindset to limit my portions and just eat half so I choose to not have it at all)

10. Meal prep chia pudding the night before  the gym 

11. Keep like 2 diff free weights and a matt laid out all the time 

12. A kettle … game changer for making sure I drink spearmint tea

13. Frozen microwave rice & costco steamed frozen veggies 

14. Red light filter on my phone after 8 pm 

15. Boy sober because they were stressing me out 

16. I ingredient prep the second I come home from the store

Ended up having to comfort my (27f) coworker (43f) after she told me she wanted PCOS for Christmas. ,"I’ve been on ozempic and metformin and have lost weight. 

Went to work after being away for a few months, my coworker started bombarding me in front of everyone of what I’m doing. 

I told her my insulin resistance is finally being controlled.

Coworker: “With what?!”

Me: Sigh. “Ozempic and metformin.”

Coworker: “Oh my god you’re so lucky how do you get ozempic???”

Me: “I have PCOS and I’m prediabetic.”

Coworker: “Lucky. I want PCOS for Christmas.”

Me: “Yeah I guess if you want to have a hard time getting pregnant, losing weight, cysts on your ovaries…” 

Coworker: “Well I already have kids so it’s all good for me there hahahaha!” 

Me: “Okay… then?” I ended up walking away to another office to talk to someone else about something unrelated. I forgot about it. 

Another coworker (40f) who was there then told her that I was angry at her (I wasn’t. It was just a really weird and insensitive thing to say but I wasn’t about to cause drama over it.) and really upset. 

She proceeds to text me all evening saying how much she loves working with me and how she was just excited and didn’t know what pcos was and that she needs reassurance that I’m not mad because she didn’t mean anything by it and blah blah blah. 

Just the most bizarre interaction ever. Sorry I just needed to get this off my chest because what the actual fuck. lmao

Turns out my PCOS isn’t PCOS after all,"I’m feeling a mixed range of emotions about this. I’ve spent the past 16 years being told that my issues were PCOS, that losing weight would help all my problems. The irregular periods, the hirsutism, the fatigue, the excessive weight gain, the issues with my libido, even my issues with constipation…

For the longest time I just took it in stride. Worked on myself, tried to lose the weight, took metformin, tried all the supplements. But there was one thing my doctors kept overlooking, which was my consistently high prolactin levels. 

When I finally found a doctor willing to listen to me about these high prolactin tests, she referred me to an endocrinologist. That endocrinologist told me that I had a condition called hyperprolactinemia and that she wasn’t comfortable even saying I had PCOS until we ruled out issues with my pituitary gland. She talked about a potential prolactinoma, a type of tumor of the pituitary gland, as the cause of my issues, so she sent me for an MRI. 

My MRI came back with something that wasn’t on my bingo card. I’ve been diagnosed with a rare congenital issue called a Rathke’s cleft cyst. This cyst is currently pushing into my pituitary gland wreaking havoc on god knows what else. I now have to have blood tests done on every hormone the pituitary gland produces, as well as have my vision extensively tested, because this 1cm cyst might be pressing on my optic nerves and messing with my peripheral vision. I will eventually have to have surgery to drain this cyst, or else it could continue to grow and make my vision and other symptoms even worse. 

I know PCOS was the logical conclusion. I know it made sense. But I’m so angry. I’ve had this cyst since birth. I am now almost 32 years old and I have been living with this without knowing, without anyone listening to me when I felt more was wrong. I was getting more frequent and worse headaches, migraines with auras, and my breasts hurt literally all the time. 

I had doctors tell me it was all in my head. I guess they were right, but not in the way they expected. I’m so exhausted and I feel like my real journey is only just beginning. 

Please, if something doesn’t feel right to you, try to seek out additional opinions and support. My condition is rare, and it’s even rarer to have symptoms from it, so it definitely is more likely to have PCOS, but I don’t want anyone to suffer like this if they don’t have to. I can’t wait to get my life back, but I am so sad it took this long. ",1503.0,[],,,,anger,"Practice deep breathing, mindfulness, and physical activities to release tension."
PCOS linked to childhood trauma?,"So I had an OB appointment recently where my doctor and I were talking about PCOS. 

She mentioned that there have been rumblings at conferences and such about PCOS possibly being linked to childhood trauma. 

She said that most people who have it had some sort of childhood trauma that kind of triggered a “fight or flight” response which could explain inflammation issues. And also in unstable households the body might hold onto more fat in case of loss of access to food. 

I can’t find much about this online, and she did say she very recently heard about it too. 

So I was just curious - what was your childhood like?  Did you have a normal, stable, loving environment or was it constantly unstable or volatile?

Mine was the latter, which got me wondering….",656.0,[],,,,fear,"Engage in relaxation techniques, talk to a counselor, and avoid stress triggers."
I am down 130lbs and my PCOS symptoms have not improved. Let me show you what the most recent research is saying. ,"PCOS is NOT fully understood. Increased levels of androgens in women can come in different ways. 

Facts: 
1. the development of insulin resistance can cause PCOS. Plenty of data shows insulin resistance increases testosterone and causes ovarian cysts 

2. high Testosterone can ON ITS OWN have Metabolic impact of androgen excess can lead to insulin resistance by decreasing insulin sensitivity, increase inflammation, amongst other things…like WEIGHT GAIN. LINK TO PAPER SHOWING THIS IS BELOW

3. High testosterone can happen because of genetics. It’s not ONLY developed from insulin resistance or weight gain!!! 

This disease isn’t fully understood and I wish I had known years ago that my PCOS symptoms were not only not my fault, but that This isn’t a simple “eat right and exercise will fix you”. Sometimes it is—- and you should be able to tell if that would solve your problem if you gained a weight and all of a sudden started to experience hormonal issues. But for a lot of us, this has been a life long thing. 

Sharing this because these are facts— and the sooner we recognize that diet and exercise DOESNT ALWAYS FIX EVERYTHING, and the narrative that is does is rooted in societal dysfunction where women are supposed to hate themselves if their bodies aren’t of a certain size, and weight is 100% determined by how good of a person you are, by how driven you are, by how smart and hard working you are. 

We are not all the same. 

EDIT: adding another study link: 

- [ ] Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders characterized by androgen excess, oligo-ovulation and polycystic ovaries. Although ovaries are the main source of increased androgens in the syndrome, between 20 and 30% of patients with PCOS have adrenal androgen (AA) excess,…. The mechanisms of these abnormalities are unclear although AA excess in PCOS is likely a complex trait, modulated by both intrinsic and acquired factors. 
….The production of AAs in response to ACTH appears to be closely related to altered factors regulating glucose-mediated glucose disposal, increased peripheral metabolism of cortisol, and to a less extent to the effects of extra-adrenal androgens, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia or obesity. 
Finally, DHEAS levels and the response of AAs to ACTH are relatively constant over time and are closely correlated between PCOS patients and their siblings suggesting that this abnormality is an inherited trait in PCOS.

"When feeling down, remember that PCOS is what helped our ancestors survive.","There is a lot of sad and negative posts on here so I thought I'd add a more positive one. This post points out just a few things out of the many in regards to PCOS. Excuse my English! 

First of all, there's an evolutionary reason for PCOS. Since our bodies often go ""huh, that works good enough"" in regards to a lot of traits, a condition that has previously benefitted us through most of history has now become less desirable simply because we live differently. A drastic change to the way we live only occurred about 200 years ago with the industrial revolution, while the condition has existed for thousands of years. 

As for why our bodies thought PCOS was a good idea? There are many aspects to it, but here are some simplified reasons: 

* Those of our ancestors who developed insulin resistance could more easily store energy in fat cells, which in turn helped ensure our survival during periods of starvation. 

* Irregular ovulation spaced out the birth of children and made it easier to care for fewer young children at once, ensuring the children actually survived to adulthood. It probably also reduced the maternal mortality as well. 

* Whilst the reason is still unknown, menopause sets in later in life for many of us, so the window to carry children is wider.

* An increased amount of androgens and insulin results in higher bone density and more lean muscle mass than the average woman. This made it possibly for our ancestors to survive harsher enviroments that demanded a lot of activity, while today, many elite athletes have PCOS since it gives them a physical advantage to perform better. 

So, simply put, we had better chances of reproduction and survival when the condition manifested in our genes. It's what's called an adaptive survival response. (Fun fact: lactose tolerance is another example of this.) 

In today's world - with a more sedentary lifestyle filled with constant access to food and hormone disrupting chemicals - it's become a *maladaptive* response instead, and this is why diet, exercise and stress management is so important (among other things). 

Hopefully this can help shed some light on why we have this!

Acting like pcos is some death sentence and we are all sick monsters IS HARMFUL,"Why people dont realize its really harmful that acting like we are all infertile? Or we are all gonna die? Im tired of reading people making posts about learning they have pcos and they are crying because they will never be able to have kids, ITS WRONG. 

Having fears, or being new to pcos, or wanting to vent is something, and spreading misinformation IS SOMETHING ELSE. While you are telling you will never be a mom because of pcos, you are also telling none of us will never be a mom because of pcos. Please do a little bit research before making posts like that. Or talking about pcos like its a death sentence, like we are infected with some horrible virus, and we are all sick IS HARMFUL. Being scared and horrified about telling people you have pcos? Why? What will happen if others learn we have pcos? We are normal people. We are not some sick monsters. Im so tired of this. Im normal! Yeah, living with pcos or maintaining it can be really really stressful, difficult, but Some people need to get more educated, you can research it a little bit before making a post here talking about how you are devastated because you learned you ‘might have pcos’ and you will never be able to have any kids. Im a woman with pcos, and reading all these ignorance and illiteracy about a disease i have is really tiring. 

Im NOT talking about people having fears, or needing to talk about how difficult is living with pcos, or having fears about having kids. Its all normal, and i myself try to support people as much as i can. This is a really supportive community for these kinds of things and im so happy for that. I hope whoever reads this post is able to get the difference between that, and what I’m trying to say. 

Edit: I DONT MEAN THAT ITS WRONG TO VENT!!! Lots of people didnt get the point of this post. My endless respect goes to everyone that is dealing with pcos for years, their emotions, what they have gone through are all so valid. THIS POST IS NOT ABOUT THIS. This post is about people that has no knowledge about pcos, not wanting to get educated about it either, and just spreading misinformation while acting like having pcos is the same with having std’s(etc) and we are all gonna die.

Please someone explain why all women with PCOS look so young. ,"I know I sound insane. But all the women I’ve met with PCOS look insanely young no matter how old they are. Idk if maybe I have just met young appearing people with it or what. But even on social media when I see PCOS posts these women look so young. 

They’ll say they are 40 and I think they are around my age sometimes! I googled it even and some articles talk about it too?? They are scientific studies so it’s hard to make it out fully. 

My aunt has it and she’s 50 and if I posted a picture of her I really don’t think anyone would’ve guessed that. Now I will say both her & my mother have aged amazing but idk. I hope this isn’t offensive. 

I don’t know if maybe it’s the excess weight ? I’ve seen studies where slightly weight excess helps aging but idk if I fully buy into it. I just want to know if anyone else notices this or if I’m maybe just biased. I am not diagnosed with PCOS by the way. I’m going for bloodwork to look into it soon but I am not currently diagnosed or known to have it. 

It’s just this past month I saw some PCOS creators talking about their journey and all them shocked me with age reveals and then I began noticing a pattern with people I knew with it.

I feel like I’ve failed myself and let PCOS win by considering Ozempic for weight loss,"For context I’m a 30yo woman diagnosed with PCOS at 19yo. I was active in high school playing volleyball, swimming and lifeguarding. Never lost weight. In my first year college after being diagnosed I decided to kick it into gear. Went to a new OBGYN, was put on metformin, I walked everywhere, lived on campus, went to the gym daily ate only at our cafeteria usually the salad bar, and didn’t snack a lot. Instead of losing weight, I gained some. This took a huge toll on my mental health and I’ve never truly recovered from it. I lost hope. After graduating I decided to try again. Went to the gym 4-5 times a week, counted calories, no weight loss. Dr recommended Phentermine (Adipex-P) and I finally lost 60 pounds (went from 250 to 190)! I was so happy! I continued to go to the gym determined to lose even more! But it slowly came back. Leading to now weighing more than I ever have at 280. My husband doesn’t understand what it feels like to fail over and over and over again and to actively hate yourself in the process. I never wanted PCOS to define who I am but I just feel like a failure. I feel like I’ve tried everything and nothing seems to work. Having a family to cook for means I can’t buy two separate grocery lists because it’s too expensive. I can barely feed them above average food let alone try and go whole food diet or keto, just can’t afford it. Then Ozempic came along. Been hearing good things from other PCOS sufferers and seeing that it may truly be something worth looking into. But I feel like I’m cheating if I decided to take it. I feel like I’ve failed to beat this thing that ruined my life and that made me question if I was even worth being called a woman knowing I may never have children, which is all I ever wanted. I feel like I have no willpower because I can’t stick with the gym or diet for any longer than a few months because nothing changes. I can’t explain to him how horrible it feels to have to admit that PCOS has won and that it has made me feel so horrible about myself that I feel like I’m letting him down constantly. I know this is irrational but at I crazy for feeling like taking Ozempic is “cheating”?

TLDR: The idea of taking Ozempic makes me feel like I have to admit defeat and that PCOS has won. It feels like cheating and I’m struggling with that thought. 

EDIT: I never thought I would get this many responses and they had me tearing up from all the supportive comments. They also give me hope that it can get better!

My ultimate PCOS guide,"I have been following this polish dietitian on ig for a few months (I'm from Poland), I applied a few changes here and there and I've seen major results! My periods got regular, I'm less bloated, I even became quite regular in the bathroom 😅 and there's a lot more! I don't think I've seen such an informative account in English so I wanted to share some tips with you bc I feel like I know stuff that all pcos girlies should know.

There's actually a lot so I'll just start from describing some alterations in my daily life.

I try to sleep for at least 8h but 9h would be even better. I measure my temperature (I'll get back to it later) and then I start from a warm water with collagen and ginger ice cube that I make once every few weeks by just blending ginger, lemon, turmeric and black pepper with a bit of water. Then I make my breakfast, what's important is that it needs to be high in protein. Usually it's 2 eggs wrap with avocado/ oats with cinnamon, chia seeds and protein powder/ 3 spoons of flax seeds blended and then cooked with almond milk, cinnamon and protein powder. -> ginger, lemon, cinnamon are good antioxidants - we need to get rid of the inflammation in our body.

After 3-4h I have lunch. I'll eat anything as long as its high in fiber and protein.

And then after 5-6h I have dinner. I still try to keep it high in protein but here I allow myself for more carbs as they allow you to get a better sleep.

If I feel like I had too much carbs or I had sth with sugar then I'd go for a walk or even walk around the house (I work from home so I really need to try hard to get my steps 😂) to lower down the glucose/insulin.

Supplements:

This is personal and it should be adjusted individually but I'll say what works well for me and what's my absolute minimum:

\- **Vit d3** after breakfast (I take at least 4k IU daily, sometimes 6k) 

\- **omega 3** after breakfast (important that the ratio is 500epa to 250dha) 

\- **B complex** in the morning bc it can make you more energized

\- **Magnesium** 2h before sleep bc it has a 'calming' effect. Good for periods cramps and helps with absorption of other vitamins.

\- **zinc**

\- **myo-inositol** 30min before sleep bc it can extend the REM sleep (should be myo:d-chiro in proporsion 40:1)

On top of that I also take sodium **sodium butyrate** and I'm starting **lactoferrin** for guts but that's personal. Sometimes if I feel like I'm lacking iron (my hair tends to fall out more before and during period) then I'd take **vitamin c** (1g) before eating sth that's high in iron like beef for example. If I feel like I'm getting sick I'd take 1g of vit c 3 times a day and a lof of vit d.

Other dietary tips:

\- the more protein & healthy fats you eat the less sugar you crave. Healthy fats will not make you fat!

\- in luteal phase and during period cut out on caffeine completely (or if you drink a few coffees cut it to 1) bc we our cortisol tends to be higher

\- you can do seed cycling - eat pumpkin seeds in your folicular phase and sesame.  seeds & sunflower seeds during ovulation and luteal phase.

\- alcohol - personally i dont drink but it causes a huge stress and inflammation to the body so try to cut it out as much as possible

\-  eat more beef just before and during period, you can also have some dark chocolate

\- **during period**: beetroots, berries, red beans, green tea, spearmint tea, dark chocolate, chicken broth, ginger

\- **after period until ovulations**: cabbage, pickled stuff, citrus fruits, oats, kefir

\- **ovulation**: red pepper, coconut, bananas,  red lentils, tuna, chia, matcha, cacao, coconut water

\- **luteal phase**: cauliflower, potatoes, sweet potatoes, apples, dates, dries plums, chickpeas, beef, peppermint, ginger

MEASURING TEMPERATURE:

Honestly earlier I never knew when to expect my period and if you asked me I never knew which phase of the cycle I was in bc of how irregular my cycles were.

I thought that this is the oldest contraception method but turns out i's a lot more than that! I was sick of guessing when my period can come and so I thought I'd give it a try. It took me around 2-3 months to learn the pattern and I'm so glad I tried bc now I always know when my period is about to come and I can be prepared. And it must be super useful when trying to get pregnant.

So basically I measure my temperature under my tongue everyday after waking up max. +/- 30 min of difference and after sleeping at least 5h. So let's say I go to sleep at midnight and I wake up at 8am, I measure it right away as soon as I open my eyes. On weekends if I want to sleep longer it can be 8.30 or if I'm awake to pee at 7.30 then that's also fine. I use digital thermometer from microlife.

So what we are looking for is a 'jump' of temperature of at least 0.2-0.6 degree Celsius , its usually within 3 days. And then the temperature will keep up until your period. With pcos it could be that you are still ovulating if your cycles are long. Even if it's a day 30 - it can still be an ovulation and you can still get pregnant!

If your temperature changes by 0.2 Celsius degree or more everyday that could be a sign high cortisol.

If your temperature is below 36.2 then it could be a sign of lack of nutrients or problems with thyroid.

The temperature will drop down to the one from before ovulation around 1 day before period. - this one is nice bc you know when to expect your period!

At least 18 days of temperature not dropping is the first sign of pregnancy.

To learn to see the pattern I'm sure you can find examples online.

WORKING OUT:

The more is not the better! It's important to keep moving and do weighlifting but it can be hard on our cortisol. So we can do high intensity from follicular phase after period until 1 week after ovulation. In luteal phase stick to yoga or smaller weight with more breaks in between. Don't work out on the first 2-3 days of your period. Also try to hit 5-10k of steps everyday. Like I said earlier it's good to walk for 10-15min after each meal - it helps with lowering the glucose/insulin

OTHER TIPS:  
\- tampons/pads - try to buy 100% cotton ones. Nowadays most of them are full of bleaches and it can really affect our hormones, pms etc.

\- try to eat a lot of different veggies. Maybe every time you go groceries try to buy a veggie that you haven't eaten in a long time. This helped me with being regular with my 💩 thanks to fiber.

\- a carrot in the morning helps with hormonal imbalances

\- try to stay away from screens for 1h before sleep

\- for me dairy and sugar makes my acne a lot worse so i cut on it too. some ppl also cut on gluten, especially if they have endometriosis

\- bone broth is a superfood, cook it if you can and have a cup!

\- if you want to go on a diet then do it in your follicular phase but still make sure you are getting enough of nutrients. eat 300-500 calories more in your luteal phase.

That's all I could think of now but there's a lot more. Let me know if you do any of those things and if they help!


Edit: 
A few more things that came to my mind:
- try to eat breakfast within 90 minutes from waking up. no coffee first thing in the morning - it raises your cortisol levels. drink it 30 minutes after your breakfast.
- if you're waking up hungry thats a good sign!
- drink green tea before having a coffee. it will make the energy kick 'burn down' slower.
- green tea is great to drink everyday bc its a great antioxidant
- if you have problems with iron try to stay away from coffee and tea 30 minutes before and after a meal. 
- the order of the meal is also important. if possible try to have fiber first (veggies), fats, protein and then carbs at the end.
- idk if i mentioned it but i cut out dairy and sugar like 90% and i think this has a huge impact on my acne.
- don't supplement iron unless your iron is basically non existent. most of the cases supplementing it wont have and will make you feel even worse

Can you get PCOS or are you born with it?,"I'm just wondering if PCOS is something we ""get"" or if it something we just ""have"".

Because I realised, that I probably had it ever since puberty (started my period very late at age 16, always irregular except when on BC age 18 to 23, enormous weight gain after getting off BC, hairloss,...). But I never heard about PCOS until a few years ago when my Gynecologist said something about follicles on my ovaries. Even then it took me 5 more years to actually think about my hormones and my weight and now I've been diagnosed with PCOS and IR since spring this year (age 34). So looking back I've come to the conclusion that I probably always had PCOS but BC did mask some symptoms and others I just never took seriously. 

I'm curious if you think you always had PCOS or if you think you acquired it at some point.

Anyone else turn the crunchy page in their PCOS journey?,"Switched plastic tupperware for glass (don’t even get me started on microwaving plastic) and threw out plastic cutting boards, buys all the “free” products (sulfate, parabens, phthalate, phenoxyethanol), switched to a clean laundry and dishwasher detergent, got rid of all fragrance in personal care products and threw out scented candles (sorry not sorry bath and body works), reusable tumbler at coffee shop or no drink for me, vacuuming higher on the priority list than before, considering organic clothing… but that’s a long term goal I mean cmon can’t do it all. 

It’s alarming, and slightly suspicious, how much these products impact our reproductive and hormonal health.

Microplastics- endocrine disruptor, can mimic estrogen in the body, can lead to metabolic disorders

Phthalates- plasticizer used in cosmetics, fragrances, toys, food packaging, and more; well known endocrine disruptor 

Parabens- preservative used in cosmetics and other personal care items; another well known endocrine disruptor and can also mimic estrogen in the body. Studies may suggest a link between exposure to these and infertility

**Healthy food** we can't just eat pizza and be on our way like other girls.

**Medication and procedures** metformin here is hella expensive, one might need laser or electrolysis, ultrasounds need to be paid for, inositol, spirpnalectone etc etc

**Mental health expenses** women with PCOS are many times more prone to having depression, EDs etc. and mental health care is more crucial for us to manage because higher levels of stress hormones make our PCOS symptoms worse which messes up our brains even more and the cycle goes on.

Is anyone else annoyed that PCOS is so broadly defined and that no ones case even looks the same yet we are all given the same treatment?,"I've had hormonal issues since I started having puberty symptoms at age 5, which were ignored. My periods began at 10 and were always normal and regular but very painful. I had hirsutism and spent thousands on laser hair removal, so that stopped being an issue.

I have never been overweight. I started getting a little chubby as I entered puberty, but my weight came down with a healthy diet and exercise. OCP ruined my sex drive and made my periods very irregular (I've tried about 7 different kinds). Fast forward 13 years, and the treatment is still the same: BCP or spironolactone. I'm off BCP and on spironolactone, but the spironolactone messes up my periods and destroys my sex drive too. I'm sick of these medications. My acne comes back as soon as I quit the spironolactone, but I feel so much better off of it. Why aren't they doing any research on PCOS and making better treatments for us?

PCOS REMISSION!!! 🥳🥳🥳,"After 6 months from my diagnosis, I met with my gyno yesterday and she told me I only have 1 cyst (follicle) on my right ovary and it's under 2mm so as of now it's not considered PCOS anymore.

P.S. this is what has worked for me: 

•Yaz birth control

•myo-inositol

•2 cups spearmint tea

•High protein, low carb diet

•Topical Tretnoin strength 0.05

Review of Metformin (as an active PCOS girlie),"As an active PCOS individual, I wanted to share my experience with Metformin over the past 4-6 months. Despite consistent workouts and a healthy routine, my weight suddenly skyrocketed after hitting 30 years old.

At 5'2 (~157 cm), I went from a steady 118 lbs (~53 kg) to gaining 32 lbs in just a year. Concerned, I consulted my doctor, who prescribed Metformin and low-dose estrogen to manage PCOS symptoms.

Fast forward to today, and I'm around 130 lbs with no changes to my diet or workout routine. It's frustrating to see influencers claim natural cures, when, like many of you, I've tried everything without success.

My skin is always bad. Expensive skin care, multiple routines daily and I will still break out all the time. My face is covered in scars too, despite multiple laser treatments. 

My hair is falling out. It doesn’t grow and hasn’t for years. It’s dead and fizzy. I get extensions. I have to style my hair every single time I go in public or wear a hat because my hair is too short to blend with the extensions well. If I don’t wash my hair, I’m oily. If I wash it, it’s dry. Dry shampoo just makes my scalp worse. I use so many products. 

My nails are gross. So thin and disgusting. I have to get manicures. It takes so much time and money. 

The swelling is exhausting. I sometimes don’t recognize myself in photos. It kills my confidence. I look way heavier than I actually am. One cheat meal and I’m done. My clothes might not fit from day to day. Wearing anything tight is sometimes so uncomfortable.If I’m going to dinner, on a date, I don’t know what to wear because I know by the end of the meal I’m going to be huge. 

I spend so much time managing symptoms. I take probiotic, prebiotic, fiber one and greens every morning, just to have bowel movements. I take insitol, a multi vitamin, B12 and vitamin D as well. Macca for my sex drive, which is sometimes non existent. A cup of green tea to start the day as well. This routine, along with my skin one, takes forever. 

The weight gain is almost instant it seems. In college, to maintain a normal weight, I wouldn’t eat for days. Even when I had abs, I was measuring my food and not spending time with anyone. I can’t be spontaneous. It’s too much work managing my symptoms. Vacations make me gain about 10lbs in a week. Takes me a year to lose the weight. Even when I’m skinny or fit, im so bloated and puffy, it often doesn’t even look like I am. 

I’m starting to just feel ugly. I can’t maintain or afford everything. It’s exhausting. I can’t bring 12 vitamins and diet things to my boyfriends every time I spend the night, it’s exhausting. I can’t do anything spur of the moment. I’m always tired. 

They want to start me on metformin but I am scared. I don’t want to stop drinking, I love going out. I don’t want to have 2 drinks. Tbh I like getting tipsy and I like going to concerts and shows. I don’t want to get all the side effects. I’m unhappy. I’m ugly and I just want to be like everyone else. I don’t want to starve myself and spend so much money and time just to look average even.

How I regulated my period on my own with PCOS!!,"Hello beautiful!! (whoever you are☺️) I’m here to just basically share my knowledge and experience with PCOS and me literally beating that b🌟tch down to get my period back 😂😂 Anyways, I’m a 23(f) who probably always had PCOS, but this year is the first time I actually noticed the symptoms. I decided to first tackle it by working out!! I’m not gonna lie, it helped, but that’s not the only thing that really helped me. 
It was this routine:
 
1. I would workout for about an hour 3-4x a week.
 
2. I got rid of sugar completely and mostly salts, but I love me some cheese fries🥲
 
3. I took supplements such as myo-inositol-D-chiro, and vitex for hormonal balance.
 
4. I ate cleaner, so I started to eat more Dark greens, more fatty fish like salmon, and more chicken salads, Eggs W/Kale or spinach.     
(I recommend just cooking at home; most restaurants have certain cooking oils that can be bad for PCOS girls).
 
5. I started to drink more tea, such as:


 spearmint tea: 
Drinking it 3x a day for 3 months has helped my facial hair come back softer and slowed down growth.

Green tea: Helped me stop getting such a bloated stomach after eating 

Turmeric: Helped calm down inflammation.

Lavender: Helped me with anxiety. 



 
6. I would SLEEP!! Please get that rest; it’s so your body can regulate and relax!!!


 
7. I mostly ate protein-type meals for breakfast (eggs). 

8. Try to drink ACV with almost every meal either before or after (this helps your digestion).

9. I found it hard to regulate sleep at times, so I would take melatonin just to find out it’s good for women with PCOS, and if you have trouble sleeping, I recommend☺️

10. Drink smoothies!! (Add: greens, fruits, and berries.) 

Lastly, I had to stay consistent!!! I couldn’t just start a supplement and stop. I had to keep going for months. 
I eventually got my period to regulate after just 3 months of doing these things( it has been regular and normal SINCE!!)

I’m no doctor, so please give me grace, but I really hope this helps ☺️💕💕

The entire visit was him telling me PCOS doesn't cause physical pain, and asking if I tried birth control (I've had an IUD for years and have one currently) he explains all the things I haven't tried (I've tried them all) and then at the end says the treatment I asked for doesn't make sense. He constantly brought up ""every study I know and questionnaire filled out by women say PCOS isn't painful"" and if I knew women who said it was I was just ""surrounding myself with my own bias""

PCOS weight loss and what the HECK ,"This is a long one.


Hey Reddit cysters,

I’m a 33F and I wanted to share my story and see if anyone else can relate or has advice. I've been battling PCOS for years, and my weight has been stuck around 250 lbs for what feels like forever. Despite my best efforts, losing weight seemed impossible.

I lead a pretty active lifestyle. I work in construction and walk an average of 15,000 steps a day on top of my very physical job. In 2023, I tried an intermittent fasting (IF) diet, which ended up backfiring—I gained 10 lbs right before my wedding.

After getting referrals for a weight loss specialist and doing a lot of my own research, I started a new routine that finally felt right. This involved taking handfuls of supplements and following a high-protein diet. For the first time in my life, my periods became regular—every 21-28 days! My cramps became manageable too. Even though I hadn’t lost any weight yet, I considered this a huge win.

Six months into this routine, I noticed my coveralls were getting looser, and my apron belly had shrunk significantly. I stepped on the scale and, to my amazement, I was 18 lbs lighter! Finally, something was working, and it didn’t feel like torture.

I’m sure many of you have had doctors tell you to just lose weight. One even suggested a 900-calorie diet. I told her I’m too active for that—I walk 15k steps a day, play softball 2-3 times a week, and do Sunday spin classes. She said I’d have to quit all my activities to lose weight. I told her I’d rather stay fat than stop moving my body.

Feeling great about my weight loss, I treated myself to some summer clothes, including a pair of jean shorts. This was only the second pair of jean shorts I’ve ever owned as an adult. I’m a bottom-heavy girl with thick legs and a big butt, and shorts have never been my thing. But these fit perfectly and made me feel amazing.

Excited about my progress, I wore my new shorts to an event with friends. The conversation shifted from their usual pregnancy talk to weight loss, so I thought I finally had something to contribute. I shared my success in losing my “apron belly” and finding a pair of jean shorts for the second time ever. They immediately shut me down, undermining my weight loss. They said it was different because I’m thick and made it seem like my weight loss was effortless and that my previous obesity was by choice. This really hurt, especially since I’ve been so open about my struggles with PCOS and the specialists I’ve seen.

I just feel offended. Believe me, I understand that losing weight after a baby is different. I’d give anything to go through what they’re experiencing. My husband and I have been trying to have a baby for 3.5 years. It feels so unfair that my weight loss story is seen as effortless and irrelevant, even though it took me years to lose just 18 lbs while they lost 40 lbs in 2 years after having a baby. Why is my achievement not worthy of being proud of? I don’t need a parade for my weight loss, but I shouldn’t be dismissed like that. Am I being a huge baby?

I’d appreciate any advice or support. Thanks for reading!

Most of the time PCOS is associated with more « masculin » proportions and it kinda makes sense, since pcos often leads to increased testosterone.

Any PCOS moms feel “normal” during pregnancy,"After being told at 14 when I was first diagnosed with PCOS that I wouldn’t be able to have kids, I got pregnant really easily last year after dropping the pill (which I’ve taken since then, so 18 years of hormonal birth control) and starting metformin.

Did anyone else feel that way? I’m getting back on metformin per my docs recommendation, but since I mentioned I may not want to get back on the pill, she’s recommending a hormonal IUD (she said she’d bet the estrogen on the pill was making me feel off, and that the IUD will only have localized progestin).

My observations as someone who has pcos and has lost over 155lb in 18 months 100% naturally.,"So in no way am I a Dr or have professional advice BUT this is my observation about weight loss and what worked for me. Dont come for me lol Im just saying what worked for me. 

Background before weightloss: Extremely high insulin (super dark patches all over my neck, knees, knuckles, etc). Borderline diabetic. High male androgen, high estrogen, low progesterone, horrible blood work, high blood sugar. Breathing issues. Lack of physical stamina, horrible hairloss. Lack of sleep and issues falling asleep. 

Now: all the issues are resolved or very controlled. My doctor and gyno were shocked at the results they couldnt believe simple weightless did all this. If I hadnt lost the weight I would probably be on a bunch of medications rn. My gyno wanted to put me on metformin to help with weight loss before but I refused and said Ill make the changes myself. Now I dont need the metformin. 

After losing 157lb to date, this is what I did to lose the weight: Simple calorie deficit and exercise. Took all my pcos friendly supplements. NO KETO (watched my carb intake and opted for healthy choices). Created a strict bedtime routine and made sure to take magnesium supplements before bed. 

This is what Ive learned over this time. 

1. If ur diet isnt sustainable forever, its not gonna work.
2. once u develop a mindset of ""how can this food help me in my pcos journey?"" the diet becomes about a life and not a limiting cage. 
3. high protein diet is key. A pcos nutritionist said the minimum amount is 100grams a day. I eat 140-160 grams. 
4. Keto may work for some pcos ladies, but its going to just make ur body more sensitive to carbs once u go off and make everything worse. All foods are welcome. As hard as it seems to believe, its true. Everything in moderation. Take the high protein, healthy fats, and veggies route. Ur not gonna die if u have rice once in a while. Or pizza. Or ice cream. But limit it. 
5. Half ass consistency is better than all or nothing mindset. This took me a min to realize but when I did, that's when the journey worked. 
6. Intense workouts will not help u lose weight. Hours of cardio wont help u. Starving urself wont help. Its gonna raise ur cortisol which will hold the fat and refuse to release it. And ur body will go into starvation mode and hold onto fat. Eating 1200 calories wont help. What will help is a healthy calorie deficit, slow low intense weightlifting and low intensity cardio like a 30 min walk. 
7. weight stalls happen. 
8. cheat days are stupid. Instead eat a little of what u enjoy every day or several times a week. Guess what? I eat icecream every day. 
9. patience is key.

What I noticed recently: There was a time period where I was doing intense workouts and eating very little. The weight loss became extremely slow. I had low energy. I was becoming frustrated. I wanted to eat everything and quit my weightloss journey. Then for the past 8 weeks I stopped working out so much and refocused my diet to high protein. I eat 140-160 grams a day. I started walking 10k steps a day and reduced my workouts to 3-4 days a week instead of 4-5 with crazy cardio. Ive been losing more weight these past few weeks than before. 

For us pcos ladies, slow consistent movement is better than stressful exercise.

The United Kingdom is the worst country to have PCOS in.,"This country is an absolute joke to be chronically ill in. People here love to boast about access to free healthcare but the NHS treats anybody who has anything more than the common cold as a fucking burden. 

The endocrinologist at my local hospital (that’s where we have to see Endocrinologists on the NHS) doesn’t wanna see me despite the fact that my androgens are elevated way past the normal range, I have male pattern facial hair & debilitatingly painful periods, and they told my GP there was nothing that could be done about it.

The problem is, I know there are things that can be done because I see American sub members talk about all the medicine they’re able to access  to help them lower their androgen levels. Metformin, spironolactone, all that good stuff. And please nobody suggest dietary changes because I’ve made every dietary change anyone could possibly think of and lost 30 kg (70 lbs) and still have elevated DHEA levels, so now I have lean PCOS.

And the only reason I was even able to find out that I still have elevated DHEA/androgens even after all the dietary changes I’ve made is because I paid £200 out of pocket to see a private endocrinologist to order the appropriate tests (that my GP can’t order). I couldn’t even get in with an NHS endocrinologist because an ovarian ultrasound didn’t show any cysts on my ovaries so they determined that there was no need to see any endocrinologist (despite the fact that A) I have a male pattern facial hair, painful periods and other PCOS symptoms and B) I’ve been diagnosed with PCOS since 2016). So I had to go the private route for testing. But I can’t afford to be under the private endocrinologist’s regular care so I was hoping to transition to an NHS endocrinologist who could prescribe me the right medicine and monitor my progress. But despite being shown my test results by my GP the NHS endocrinologist doesn’t wanna see me to even discuss what can help. I need medicine and can’t find anyone in this fucking shit health care system to give it to me and give me the care necessary for people taking them.  I see American sub members talk about getting prescribed these medicines and having their hormone levels monitored to track their progress. I can’t find anyone to do any such thing for me unless I spend £200/appointment with a private endo. Even some of the private endos are reluctant to prescribe the same medication I see prescribed so often to PCOS patients elsewhere. So much for the marvel of “free healthcare”.

I was just diagnosed with PCOS at 24 and I can't stop crying ,"I'd been having a little spotting in between my period so I went to the gynecologist. She stuck something up me and showed me my ovaries and they had all these cysts on them. She told me it looked like PCOS and test results came back confirming that. I really can't stop crying because I'm so scared and I don't know what to do. All my periods have been regular, I haven't ever missed a period. Flo tracks my periods accurately and they always come. I don't have any overgrowth of hair, maybe an occasional pesky chin hair or neck hair. I've actually lost weight rather than gained so I don't know how this happened. I'm not pre diabetic or diabetic either. All my results came back normal, except the fact that my testosterone levels were at an 55.4H and I had high androgen levels. I'm so sad, all I can do is cry. I don't want to struggle to have kids. I  know I sound ignorant but I'm just so sad and I don't know what to do. Do I freeze my eggs? Why do my ovaries look like that? How do I reduce my testosterone levels? Do I take medication my whole life? I'm already on antidepressants and ADHD medication. I feel like my body hates me and just doesn't want to work.

Cannot lose PCOS weight even after one year of a strict healthy diet & lifestyle! What has worked for you?,"One year ago I gained a lot of weight within a few months. I went from being a size 6/8 to a size 12.  months prior to the weight gain I was diagnosed with PCOS at age 27.

I am frustrated as I have tried so many things to lose weight in the past 12 months including;

* A high protein, mainly whole food diet. A typical day for me is Chia seed pudding & berries for breakfast, chicken salad for lunch and Salmon, sweet potato and greens for dinner. If I want something sweet it will be dark chocolate or banana and peanut butter for example. 
* I take berberine which has helped reduce sugar cravings and food noise.
* I started 1,500mg Metformin 9 months ago which has regulated my periods. But it has caused acne for me and some hair loss.
* I’ve been strictly gluten and dairy free for 9 months. This seems to have helped a bit with extreme bloating and inflammation but tbh I find this measure quite miserable as I love sharing food with friends and family.

* I always get at least 10,000 steps a day.
* I go to the gym 3 times a week to do strength training, pilates and Zumba for fun.
* I get 8 hours sleep without fail. 
* I stopped drinking coffee and alcohol.
* I regularly consume gut healthy foods like apple cider vinegar, kimchi, kombucha etc.
* I do lymphatic drainage massages every night.
* I started therapy to heal childhood trauma.

Despite all this, my body has been incredibly resistant to weight loss. I am wondering if there is something else at play? It could be due to something else including:

* I recently got an ADD diagnosis and have started Elvanse medication a couple of days ago. I am hoping that this will address the stress I experience in my work and home life.
* At the time of the weight gain I had just quit my SSRI medication cold turkey. I wonder if I need to be patient and wait for my brain to recover from that shock/withdrawal? 
* Extreme constipation, blood in my stool, painful bloating, pelvic pain and brain fog are other major symptoms for me. Sometimes I wonder if I have an autoimmune disease like Hypothyroidism or celiac disease. The NHS tells me my blood work is okay and just gives me laxatives…
* Nine months before my weight gain I took a few rounds of antibiotics and strong painkillers for a tooth infection and I think it negatively affected my gut health maybe causing SIBO or Candida overgrowth. I also lived in a damp room for three years at that time.

PCOS Weight loss - am I going crazy or is my partner gaslighting me?,"I've been with my boyfriend for several years now and about 4 years ago I was diagnosed with PCOS. The weight gain was rough (along with lots of other symptoms) throughout the years. I have always been active, particularly so at the start of my PCOS, thinking I could get it under control with diet and exercise. Despite being hungry all the time and only eating roughly 1500-1600 calories a day for at least a few weeks (and not too much more for the subsequent months), I was still gaining so much weight. At one point I was so close to tipping over the normal BMI threshold into the overweight category - when put into context that I started off at the bottom end of the normal weight category, it was so devastating. I didn't feel like myself at all.

I was doing some research on reddit as well as other platforms and found that other women with insulin resistance PCOS also had issues losing weight despite counting calories and I wasn't the only one.

My bf is dead set on the fact that if I stick to calories in < calories out, I will lose weight. I keep telling him that it's harder for us and that I've tried it and it hasn't worked for me. It's really frustrating to say the least and also hurtful that he thinks I'm *choosing* to gain weight in a sense. 

Firstly, am I going crazy and not counting correctly like do I need to get a weighing scale to be more accurate (please be straight up with me)? Is it possible to lose weight if we limit the amount of calories we intake as women with PCOS? or is he just gaslighting me like every other doctor I've been to?

I would appreciate any insight into this.",238.0,[],,,,sadness,"Consider therapy, meditation, and connecting with supportive friends or family."
Let’s get Semaglutide and GLP-1 meds FDA approved to treat PCOS,"Does anyone know how we can get medications FDA approved for PCOS? Like maybe prompt them to do studies and help us out?? 

Backstory:
I’m 26 and I’m a PCOS girlie, I have insulin resistance and I also have tummy issues. Metformin did not work for me at all, it made me so sick and after months on it my bloodwork showed that my insulin actually went up! 
My insurance approved wegovy but they won’t approve ozempic. They both are semaglutide so that’s basically like walking into a store and the salesman says you can buy the Nike shoes but not the Adidas. Why? Bc he said so. 
It doesn’t matter to them that I’ve had Ozempic before or that it’s a cheaper medication OR that wegovy is literally on a national back order and I can’t get it.

I’m so angry and all I want is to feel better and treat my insulin so I don’t end up diabetic. I already diet and exercise, literally I could look at celery and gain weight, nothing works and I’m definitely not looking for that kind of advice rn.

Then I was thinking about all of you, how it’s so messed up that our treatment options are so limited and I can’t be the only one ready to fight for better treatments. I think if we put our heads together maybe we can find a way or start a movement. We are many, and we are strong! If we’re loud enough someone will listen! 

I’ve got hella fatigue and nausea but I will fight. We are worth it! So please share your thoughts and feelings here, what treatments would help you that we don’t have access to? Who do we contact? Do we start a petition? Contact news outlets? 

How can we bring attention to this illness that affects up to 12% of the population. Roughly FIVE MILLION people?

EDIT: I think people are missing the point. The point is that we are suffering, treatments aren’t accessible or affordable, there is a very large lack of knowledge and awareness about PCOS and THAT is what is hindering us. I think if people knew how rough it is out here there would be more research happening, more medications being tested, and more ways to get treatment. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but we all know that each persons PCOS is different and different people need different treatments. So shouldn’t we be helping each other get access to the treatment they need even if it’s not one we want for ourselves?? I think so.

Incidental finding of 4cm nodule on thyroid.,"Advice welcome! A recent routine spinal MRI (for MS, in remission) revealed multiple nodules on my thyroid between 1.8 and 4 cm.

Nervous about my FNA Thyroid Biopsy ,"UPDATE BELOW First Post⬇️⬇️⬇️ 


Any words of encouragement? 
In March of this year, I noticed a huge lump on my throat (I don't know where this thing came from all of a sudden, I look at photos of myself last Autumn and do not see it)

I've had an ultrasound, as well as CT scan.
My physician was alarmed when he read the results of the scan, told me he didn't want to lie to me.."" I don't like what these results say"" 
Was very pushy about getting me into a ENT, wanted all to move FAST. (I believe he's trying to gear me up for the possibility of this being a negative thing, he said it could be nothing)
He is wonderful and has not exacerbated my anxiety - if anything I appreciate he is straight forward.

I have 3 nodules. One is a Triads 1, the second is a Triads 3, the last, Triads 4 (solid, macrocalcifications, about 2CM)

The 4 is the suspect.

I am finally getting my biopsy in a couple days. 


I appreciate it 🤍  

**UPDATE AS OF 8/3/2024***
I had my FNA biopsy performed on 7/11/24.
On 7/17/24 I was diagnosed with Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma. 
I had surgery to remove my thyroid, as well as cancerous lymph nodes on 8/1/24 
I am very sore, very tired - I am optimistic and have a great sense of calm.

I am very fortunate to have a highly experienced ENT doctor, who also performed the surgery. 

My next step is to see an Endocrinologist and receive RAI treatment. That will be in 6 weeks. 
In the meantime, I will not be given the thyroid replacement hormone until after the RAI. 
I am worried about the ups and downs with loss of my thyroid, I am aware I will be fatigued. Possibly more depressed.
Does anyone have any advice for this period of lack of thyroid hormone? 
What I should do if I am feeling VERY off, etc??

I will be seeing my ENT/surgeon in 2 days, to remove the bulky dressing, discuss surgery in simple terms and well, hope for the best!

My MIL has developed psychosis out of nowhere. Questions about thyroid. Thank you in advance.,"**Could this be related to her thyroid meds?**

I understand that few of us are actual Doctors, but I still value the opinions of people who know more about these things through personal experience.

My MIL, a very high functioning and well put-together Nurse, all of a sudden over the last few months has developed psychosis. She is at the point now where she things her son is going to hurt his father, that we are trying to take her money (makes no sense for a variety of reasons), and just other paranoid delusions. We have had to forcibly hospitalize her, which pains us greatly, but we felt it was the best options.

I was hoping if I could post some basic demographic and vitals information if any of you fine people might chime in with thoughts, experiences, or anything really. We are hoping that it is related to thyroid issues. MIL has told us that is the prelim diagnosis at this point but she is an unreliable narrator and the hospital she is in, well, it leaves a lot to be desired. We are currently trying to move her to a better facility, but the holidays have made it complicated. Anyway:

Age: 64

Conditions: hashimotos 

Gender: Female

Prescribed: unithroid, np thyroid (subcutaneous pellet), lexapro, some form of ADHD med like Concerta

The symptoms have been building for months with occasional odd statements. Right around she got the pellet in august was when we first noticed odd behavior when she showed up unannounced at our house acting a little strange but then she seemed normal after that. We went on a trip to Colorado about a month ago and she seemed fine, with little odd things like refusing to ride escalators. Then all of a sudden she became increasingly paranoid to the point that she thought one of her sons had died and been replaced. 

That was a serious wake up call. Unfortunately we had to have her placed on a 72 hour hold. They also found an unruptured aneurysm but it's unrelated and frankly, I think that's a misdiagnosis and so do some of my doctor friends. I work in healthcare but not in a clinical capacity.

As you all are probably one of the best resources regarding thyroid health, have any of you heard of or experienced anything like this? Having medication interaction would really be the best case scenario, and MIL has said that's her diagnosis but remember she is a nurse and is also currently an unreliable narrator. We are engaging a patient advocate (private, not facility based) to help us with this. Her immediate family is having difficulty communicating with the behavioral health unit at this hospital, everybody is frustrated - whereas I am much more able to calmly communicate. Not sure why I'm saying this other than to illustrate that we are having problems interfacing with the doctors to get firm diagnosis, but we should have that resolved today.

Any thoughts or contributions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, sincerely ",6.0,[],,,,fear,"Engage in relaxation techniques, talk to a counselor, and avoid stress triggers."

Controversial take: Elevated Thyroid Antibodies -- why do some people think this is a thyroid disorder and others don't?,"Like the title says: Do elevated thryoid antibodies *mean anything?!* I've been hearing a lot of ""oh, that means you have hashimotos!"" and also ""they mean absolutely nothing."" Different doctors saying different things so.... what's the deal?

My PCP tested my thyroid levels and everything is normal except my Thyroglobulin antibodies + TPO antibodies are high. She said, ""yep, hashimotos / thyroid disorder."" I was referred to an endocronologist who possibly was alive during WWI and had lower reviews than my worst Uber driver situation. (Live in big city = big big wait times for all other endos, slim pickins...). He didn't even test my antibodies and said I'm totally fine and there was no point to test antibodies, just TSH + Free T4, etc. (to which, my levels are pretty ideal)...(｡•́︿•̀｡) Other people on the internet have agreed with him, others have agreed with my PCP... I am L O S T.

I've had so many tests, scans, ultrasounds... everything seems pretty normal except my elevated thyroid antibodies but I'm feeling higher than a kite. Super lightheaded and vision is weird, lil dizzy when I'm out walking about and very fatigued. Sweating more than usual, like... a lot on my palms/underarms. Feeling slightly cold (I'm pretty tiny so I'm always cold, so that's kind of normal), brain fog, etc etc.

  
Am I crazy? Do antibodies even matter? Can they cause ""thyroid storm"" or ""flare ups""? Not looking for a doctor advice, just curious and feeling like everyone is telling me something different.

Luckily I was able to get it done that week. Come to find out it's a 2.7 cm TI-RADS category 4 nodule. ""Further evaluation with ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration is advised"". I'm so shocked and confused how this kind of popped up out of nowhere. I have no family history of thyroid issues, but my Dad has had acid reflux and digestive issues almost his whole life.

What's even more unnerving is the scheduler said I was getting it done tomorrow, well, she had to call me back and apologized letting me know it's not until next month... I'm really trying my hardest to keep calm and not freak out about the worst. I have my endoscopy (and a colonoscopy) a few days prior as well. I'm also concerned because my cough hasn't gone away, my esophagus just feels inflamed or raw most of the time and I can feel the nodule and it being harder to swallow since. I also have had right/back neck pain and strain around the trapezius area for a long while, but have always attributed it to work or sleeping on it wrong as I do have some muscle imbalances. I've been trying to be incredibly careful in what I eat and making sure it's not too acidic while I'm also trying to figure out what foods could be triggering my symptoms. I've essentially stopped eating and drinking all the things I love to try and tackle this.

Is acid reflux with thyroid issues or nodules common?

My Thyroid Lobectomy Experience and Scar Recovery Pictures,"Hi Reddit, I (28F) had my right thyroid lobe surgically removed 8 months ago, and I wanted to post about my experience here. I don’t normally use Reddit, but the resources on this sub were amazingly helpful leading up to my surgery. I hope that sharing my experience can similarly help others in the future. 

I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism after my primary care physician ordered blood tests as part of my routine physical. At that time, I was having a lot of “symptoms” that I didn’t realize were symptoms. I had horrible anxiety for many years, brittle nails, and a huge appetite, but there always seemed to be an easy explanation for these problems and I didn’t ever once think my thyroid might be the issue. 

# Pre-Surgery Process

After my blood tests came back showing extremely low TSH several months in a row, my doctor referred me to a specialist. The endocrinologist I worked with discovered a 3cm thyroid nodule, which was invisible because it was on the “back” of my thyroid. It could be felt only when I tipped my head back and swallowed. The endocrinologist performed a biopsy to check for cancer and thankfully it was benign. He ordered some imaging and an iodine uptake test to determine if the nodule was “hot” aka making too much thyroid hormone. 

I want to pause at this point and say I really wish I had listened to my primary doctor and the endocrinologist much sooner than I did. Between the first blood test and the iodine uptake test, I had waited about 18 months. I kept hoping the problem would magically go away on its own. I was thinking that because I didn’t have any “serious” symptoms (like extreme weight loss or hair loss) I didn’t want to do anything “drastic.” I think this was a huge mistake, because I’m also an athlete. I run and cycle, and I trained myself into a serious hole over this time period (and probably had been on this trajectory for many years.) 

By the time I actually received treatment, I was extremely fatigued (could barely make it upstairs by the end of the day) and I was snappy, irritated, and paranoid. I could not recover from the simplest, easiest workouts, and I’m still recovering from this “hole” months later. 

Back to the diagnosis…. After the iodine uptake test came back showing that my thyroid nodule was extremely active, I went back to my primary doctor. I did not receive much encouragement from the endocrinologist I worked with, and in retrospect I think it’s because he had a focus in treating diabetes. He was not used to working with my condition, and I felt like he was not listening to my concerns. 

My doctor referred me to a local thyroid surgeon who specializes in thyroidectomies and lobectomies. She was much more familiar with my symptoms and after she performed her own in-office ultrasound, I booked an appointment to remove my overactive thyroid lobe. 

# The Surgery

My surgery experience was overall very positive, given the circumstances. I was directed not to eat or drink starting the night before surgery. My husband came with m to the hospital, and the surgeon met with me after I had been prepped by the nurses. She had me move my head around and drew a guideline for herself so that my scar would blend into an existing line on my neck. 

My memories after this are still a little fuzzy, but I was wheeled back into the (cold!) operating room. The anesthesiologist had me count backwards from 10, and I don’t remember making it to 8. I woke up, very loopy, when I was being wheeled from the operating room to the recovery room. I was extremely nauseous, and the nurses were most concerned with making sure I did not vomit. I was given a lot of medication to settle my stomach, and could only drink small amounts of water despite feeling very thirsty. 

I had very little pain on my actual surgery site. The worst discomfort was my throat from the intubation. I was kept on a clear liquid diet (no ice cream!) and they kept me in the hospital overnight. The following morning, my surgeon came to visit me before I was discharged. She said she doesn’t visit patients the same day after surgery because they don’t remember what she tells them (I believe it!) She told me that based on the way my nerve was almost “embedded” in my thyroid nodule, I probably had it for many years. The nerve caused the surgery to be about 15 minutes longer than normal, but I will have to take her word for it because I barely remember anything from that day. 

# Recovery from surgery

I took two full days off of work to mostly sleep and walk around. My surgeon encouraged me to be as active as felt comfortable. She told me not to remove the surgical bandages until our follow up one week later. I practiced gently moving my head and took a lot of walks/gentle bike rides. Overall, my pain was easily managed with Tylenol and I stopped taking anything after about 5 days. My neck was completely numb (like how your face feels after getting a filling at the dentist) from about an inch below the incision all the way up to an inch below my chin. The numbness is almost entirely gone now, with just a small spot right above my scar that I can’t really feel. 

My surgeon had me come into her office for my one week checkup. My stitches were already dissolving, and my care at this point was to keep the wound slathered in a generous layer of aquaphor and keep it out of the sun. I kept using aquaphor for about six weeks, at which point I transitioned to using silicone scar tape. I used the scar tape for about 6 months, and only recently have stopped wearing it day and night. My surgeon stressed the importance of keeping the scar out of the sun, so I always wear neck gaiters/sun strips/lots of sunblock. I have been very fortunate with my scar, and credit that mostly to my surgeon’s skill, following the aftercare to the letter, and doing gentle scar massage every day. 

I regained full mobility after about three months. I have had some weird “twinges” of pain/cramping, which I understand is a normal part of the healing process, even months later. Most people say they cannot see my scar unless I point it out to them. 

My primary care physician has taken over getting my levels checked periodically. I am on a low dose of levothyroxine. I adjusted pretty quickly to taking it right when I wake up (okay to be honest… my husband is an angel who reminds my sleepy self to take it when I forget). 

# Changes

I wish I had done this years ago. I’m not exaggerating when I say this is the biggest transformational event I’ve ever had for my physical and mental health. Here are the changes I’ve noticed:

* Massive reduction in anxiety and mood swings. I no longer “choke up” whenever I’m marginally upset. 
* My appetite is down to “normal” levels. I don’t feel like my stomach will consume my spine if I skip lunch. 
* I have more energy. I’m not asleep on the couch at 8:00pm anymore. 
* I am slowly re-introducing marathon training, so it’s tough to say at this stage, but no problems with running and recovery 
* My nails no longer flake. They are growing slower, but strong and less brittle. 
* My body hair is growing in slower. This one is seriously mind blowing. I always thought people were exaggerating when they said that shaving would last a few days, because I would be prickly again within a few hours. Now, I’ve noticed that shaving my legs will leave me “acceptably soft” for about two days. 
* Potentially related to the last point, I’m a lot less hypersensitive and jumpy. I had a lot of issues with touch/sensory input. There were a lot of things that “hurt” which no longer do. Potentially nsfw:>! My husband is very happy because our sex life has greatly improved in the last few months, because I’m a lot more relaxed and I’m not in random, unintentional pain!<. 

Hopefully, long term I may be able to stop taking levo every day. But it’s really not a huge imposition and if the left half of my thyroid never “picks up the slack,” the changes in my health are certainly worth it. 

I hope my experience share helps someone else in the future. I was so scared of the surgery, and I wish I hadn’t been. This subreddit is full of so many kind and supportive people. I want to extend a huge thank you to everyone who has posted before; your words helped me navigate what was otherwise a very confusing and nerve wracking experience.

I was told not to touch it or wash it until the doctor could remove it to inspect the stitches 1 week later.

Thyroid lobectomy or other options?,"Hi. 

Long story short, I did a CT scan in May, a nodule was found in my thyroid. I've done an x-ray, multiple blood tests and had a biopsy since then to check it. I've even had a camera up my nose and down my throat prior to the biopsy. 

The results came back benign however because of the size, the ENT doctor told me they couldn't guarantee it's 100% benign. She told me I can get that lobe removed OR I could keep doing biopsies. 

Personally I found it draining and a bit traumatizing to do the biopsy. It was my first one ever and I didn't have an easy time waiting to hear back. I don't want to do that over and over. 

Obviously it was great news for it to be benign. 

A couple of people have tried to talk me out of the surgery however if the only other option is biopsy after biopsy, I dont think I have the mental capacity to do that. It's like russian roulette every few months. 

I'm wondering if anyone else has been in this position? I feel like doing the surgery is optimal. My biggest concern is am I making too big of a decision ""for no reason""? Is there another option I'm not aware of? 

I have an upcoming appointment, I just needed to vent. Thank you for reading and any advice.

My mother will have a total thyroid removal tomorrow.,"Hey everybody,

English is not my native tongue so please excuse any mistake.

During a regular checkup one month ago,which my mother hasn't done in decades, they found one benign nodule in each side of her thyroid. The bigger one is over 5cm and it is moving towards her chest, I don't know the exact terminology. Any way, she is scheduled for surgery in exactly 16 hours. She will stay one night in the hospital for supervision.

Do you have any advice of how can I help her go through the post op as smoothly as she can? 

In terms of food, what should I stock up our fridge with? Vitamins?

Does she have to stop smoking, and if yes for how long(hopefully forever)?

Doctor said she will have to take a pill for life but didn't go into much detail. Anything else you think is important, please do share.

Thyroid Nodule grew Unchecked for 3 years!,"Hey Reddit community,

I wanted to share a bit of a health journey I've been on recently, in hopes of maybe finding some support or advice.

About three weeks ago, I was casually reviewing my medical records after getting access to the hospital’s portal and stumbled upon something that hadn't been addressed: a thyroid nodule. Turns out, it was first noted in July 2022 and measured 1.5 cm.

Fast forward six months, and I noticed in my records that the nodule had grown to 1.9 cm. Again, it slipped through the cracks until now, a year and a half later, when I called my doctor and informed her of its existence. The ultrasound revealed it has reached 2.4 cm and has microcalcifications, moving it to a TIRAD level of 4. I have a FNA on Friday.

Of course, my primary concern is that it has been growing steadily over these years, and now it’s finally being addressed. I'm trying to understand the implications, **especially the likelihood of it having spread** if it turns out to be cancerous.

Thyroid medication for weight loss?,"Hi,
I am 57 and started going to an anti aging and weight loss clinic recently.  I recently gained 25 lbs in the last year and I want to lose it. My libido has dropped as well as other functions.

Thyroid/anxiety help ,"Hey all! 

Wanted to share my story with you to hear your thoughts!

I am a 35/F. Struggled with social anxiety most of my adult life. Nothing I wanted to take anti anxiety medication for despite it being pushed on me. 

I have also struggled with under active thyroid my entire adult life. I have been on levothyroxine with adjustments every year or so. 

One week from today I started feeling very very low, weak and had a headache. That night it turned into a panic attack and night sweats. That morning (thanksgiving) it grew even worse and resulted in me believing I was having a heart attack and went to the ER where they told me I was fine I was having an anxiety attack. Gave me a pill to help me relax (it didn’t work) and sent me home. The uncomfortable feeling lasted almost a week with panic attacks similar to that every other day since then. When I am not having an attack I am very tense and on edge (the feeling you get when you see a car coming from behind you in your mirror and you know it’s gonna rear end you so you tense up). 

I went to my family doctor yesterday. She told me it has everything to do with anxiety and not much to do with my thyroid. I explained to her that I didn’t understand how I’ve been fine this entire time without attacks and she said it happens. I did let her know that I’ve lost 21 pounds in the last 4 months due to a lifestyle change. She did also note that my eyes are bulging and I had lid lag which are signs of Graves’ disease. I confessed to her that I stopped taking my thyroid medication a few days ago. I told her the reason I did it is because when I would take the medication I could feel my heart rate rising within an hour of
Me taking it and I thought it was the cause of my issue. She of course, told me I shouldn’t have done that and I know I shouldn’t have but in my gut I felt like it was hurting me.

She suggested more anti anxiety medication. I asked her if this could have anything to do with low vitamin d as I googled and it said it could cause panic attacks. She said no but she would run the labs anyways. 


My labs came back at my vitamin d level being 19 and normal range is 30. She sent over some vitamin d for me to take weekly.

My thyroid labs came back as the following - 
TSH 4.68 - normal is .35 to 5
Free t4 1 - normal is .8 to 1.5
Anti Thyroglobulin - 25.9 - normal is under 4
Thyroid Peroxidase Antibody 3482 normal is under 60.


Nurse called and told me she was sending over vitamin d and to continue my 112 dose of Levo and of course the anti anxiety medication. 

I know we are not doctors here and my doctor seems like a great person but I’m just worried about starting a medication when it seems some of those thyroid numbers are wayyyyy off and my vitamin d levels seemed so low. 

As a human, a normal everyday person. Would you start a new “life long” medication based off of that? I just can’t make it make sense to me that I am totally fine my entire life without panicking like that and for a week solid I am like this out of nowhere.

Nodule & Thyroid Growth - Scared 😔,"I went for my annual ultrasound on my thyroid nodule. I've been doing so for about 5 years, and everything has remained the same size. It was always TI RADS 3 because it was solid and hyperechoic or isoechoic, but it grew the past year in two dimensions. Nothing happened for over 5 years, and now it's grown this year. 

For years, it was 1.8 x 1.1 x1.0 CM

Now it's 2.1 x 1.2 x 1.2 CM.

The right side of my thyroid has also got larger. 

I am a hypochondriac, and I've literally been spiraling thinking it's cancer and that it's spread to other areas of my body. My lymph nodes were normal, but I go for the fine needle biopsy on Friday, and this waiting game for someone with this severe level of anxiety is torture. 

I'm so stressed and worried and scared, and I'm struggling. 


The doctor tried to reassure me that even benign nodules can grow. And that only 3 to 5% are cancer. But that's probably not for growing ones? But why would my thyroid grow too on that side?

Does anyone have any stories of benign nodues growing or their thyroid growing and it not being cancer?

What do you all think?

I know it doesn't help thinking of all of this, but I just couldn't imagine it growing and my thyroid if it's benign after not growing for so long.

I guess I'm looking for other people's experiences with being diagnosed. Did you have cancer elsewhere? How do you cope with the anxiety of not knowing if it's spread? Could it be medullary thyroid cancer and they read it wrong? I also read people with PTC have a higher risk of developing other cancers down the road.

I am 32F and have been diagnosed with a thyroid nodule on my right lobe. It measures around 1.5cmx1cm. I don't have any bad symptoms other than hairfall. But I am also 6 months postpartum, which might also be the case for my hairfall. 
I had an FNAC last week as the nodule showed TIRADS 4 characteristics and the nodule turned out to be Benign with Bethesda ll. 
But my endo has been pushing for the complete removal of my thyroid even though there are no problems.

Thyroid Cancer Risk? Thoughts please!,"A year ago I had my first thyroid ultrasound. Right lobe was 4.0 x 1.1 x 1.2  cm, left lobe was 4.1 x 1.4  x 1.5 cm, and Isthmus was 0.2 cm. One left side nodule was found and it was 1.3x .6x .7 cm. Since it was solid, they wanted me to do a fine needle biopsy. During the biopsy, they had to do 6 passes to get a sample. And with the 6th one they said ""well I guess we have enough cells"". Not very confident at all. Pathology came back normal/ benign. 

Fast forward to my follow up ultrasound this week (one year later). My left lobe has grown a lot! Right lobe: 4.7 x 1.9 x 1.8 cm, Left lobe: 5.9 x 1.8 x 1.3 cm, Isthmus 3 mm. My left lobe nodule is similar at 1.1 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm. Here was the notes of the nodule: Composition:  Solid or almost completely solid. Echogenicity:  Very hypoechoic. Shape:  Wider than tall .Margin:  Smooth. Echogenic foci:  Punctate echogenic foci. TR level: 5.

I am guessing doctor will tell me we want to do another biopsy, which I am fine with. I am wondering if the left lobe growth is normal or is this leaning towards thyroid cancer?

I of course have done the one thing you aren’t supposed to do and I’ve been googling non-stop. I’m scared that when I do my biopsy that it’s going to come back as Anaplastic thyroid cancer because now I feel it and I feel like it’s gotten so much bigger in such a short time. I don’t feel any other symptoms. It’s just this noticeable lump you can see if I put my head back and swallow. I don’t know if maybe I got it in my head that it’s aggressive kind of cancer or what. 

I mean I know it’s rare. But the fact I have two young kids is why I am really so upset and have convinced myself that it’s Anaplastic. Please just give me some positive vibes and words of kindness.

Rapid growth thyroid,"What kind of experiences have others had with similar symptoms?

The symptoms include almost constant pain in the thyroid area that radiates to the neck and ear. Resting heart rate, even while sleeping, can be over 100, and physical fitness has completely deteriorated. Inflammatory markers have been clearly elevated at least since August.

Thyroid values have ranged from S-TSH 0.02-0.27 and T-4V 16-20. An ultrasound was done on the thyroid, and in two months the size at left side has increased from ~4cm to 4x7x8cm, with low echogenicity throughout, and at least one cyst with calcification larger than 1cm.

Three needle samples have been taken, with the first two showing no thyroid cells, and results of the third are still pending.

Could the high heart rate be due to hyperthyroidism, even though T-4V levels are still within the normal range?

The rapid growth rate of the thyroid is puzzling; I understand these are usually slow-growing. Has anyone else experienced similar issues?

I’ve been on corticosteroids for over a month and also taking a beta-blocker, and I feel slightly better with the medication. According to two different ultrasound doctors, it doesn’t seem to be an inflammatory change.

Thyroid biopsy ,"
Edit: I added the biopsy results below


1. Thyroid, Right (Fine Needle Aspirate): Right Thyoid Nodule Mid
Final Diagnosis:
The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology Category:
BENIGN: Consistent with chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis.
 
Nodule Characteristics: 
1.8 cm




So long story short. Diagnosed with hashimotos and hypothyroidism back in 2018 when this was first found. Was a tirads 3 back then. Biopsy was done and was good. Wasn't put on medication back then. Fast forward to 2023, went to a new Dr when my thyroid was elevated and was checked again via ultrasound to check on thyroid and put on Levothyroxine. Ultrasound said the nodule was Tirads 5 and suspicious. So a biopsy was scheduled and these were the findings. My Dr didn't seem to concerned and was basically told to ""wait and see"". Shortly after I found out I was pregnant. Now, after being postpartum I am wondering if I should reach out again to revisit this with the SAME Dr, or if I should go with a different one. I already have an appointment with them scheduled for March (earliest). Below is the findings from the last biopsy in 2023:





FINDINGS:  Preliminary ultrasound was performed to identify the nodules of interest.   -RIGHT NODULE 1: 1.2 x 1.1 x 1.13 cm in the mid lobe. Composition: Solid or almost completely solid (2 points) Echogenicity: Hypoechoic (2 points) Shape: Taller-than-wide (3 points) Margin: Ill-defined (0 points) Echogenic foci: Macrocalcifications (1 point)  ACR TI-RADS total points: 8 ACR TI-RADS risk category: TR5 (>/= 7 points)  PROCEDURE:  The patient was positioned supine on the procedure table. Preliminary imaging was obtained to determine the approach. All elements of appropriate sterile preparation and technique were followed pertaining to the operators, patient, equipment, and supplies.  After administration of superficial lidocaine, deeper anesthetic was administered using ultrasound guidance.   8 passes with a 26 gauge needle for fine-needle aspiration were inserted into the right mid thyroid nodule under ultrasound guidance.   FNA samples were provided for rapid on-site evaluation to the pathologist who deemed the FNA sample less than optimal.  SPECIMENS SUBMITTED:  6 FNA samples and rinse for cytologic analysis 2 FNA samples for AFIRMA testing  COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications. Post-procedure imaging demonstrates no significant findings.

Ablation of Thyroid nodules,"I am 1 week after RFA on a hot (autonomous) module. Very similar to the picture I have  a couple of small normal ish nodules but one large hot one that is light up like a Xmas tree on an uptake scan. About 3-4cm

To the extent this is useful to anyone:

What is the process? 
Turned up at the hospital at the appointment time, had an IV fitted. The IV was actually used for anything in the end I’m guessing it’s a precaution. Had the ablation and then stayed overnight, went home in the morning.

How long did the procedure take?
The actual procedure itself - about 10 to 15 mins. Total time about half an hour.

Did it hurt?
Yes moderately. I am guessing it hurt me more than most for 2 reasons. 1) I declined any local anaesthetic. 2) I have TMJ and jaw/muscle issues and the pain tends to radiate to the jaw. 
So they literally go in with a large needle find the nodule assisted by echo, turn on the heat. The worst part of the pain for me was felt in the jaw. Overall I’ve had more comfortable 10 mins in my life but it is quite manageable.

What else does it feel like?
You feel pressure and some crunching sensations. 

What happens after?
Dressing over the puncture area of the neck and go to rest. Normal pain killers offered for pain.

What were the alternatives to this?
RAI or partial TT - the usual. I declined both in favour of RFA as the “newer” technique. The reasons are quite straightforward at least they were to me. RAI has a very good success rate of curing hyper but it can be necessary to do it again the future. There is also a 50/50 chance of going hypo and needing lifetime meds along with the fact that you need to take a relatively strong nuclear dose. I’d stress though by any measure or study RAI is very safe. 
I declined the operation because the complications rate is slightly higher even though the hospital is an expert thyroid centre doing a lot of them. There is also chance of hypo and lifetime meds being needed.
RFA (or microwave or any of their other types) is the only option that will destroy a nodule and keep the rest of the healthy thyroid tissues intact.

What happens next?
I’ve stopped taking methiamzole completely and we will see how this goes at the next appointment in 3 months to check the hyper is cured. I am 1 week out, I will probably get. Blood test done shortly just to check how post op.

NHS Thyroid Nodules,"Hello!

I am a lurker here and I've seen several posts and used Dr. Google to tell me about thyroid nodules and the risk of malignancy.  I'm in Scotland and looking for some advice.

Last year, I found a lump just below my Adams apple so seen a GP, who referred me to an ENT thyroid specialist.  The waiting list was long so I ended up having a private ultrasound March 2023. 2 nodules found.  One on the right lobe measuring 1cm, some vascularity, solid nodule, slight irregular margins indicative of a U3 nodule and another on the left lob which was a cyst, this was with a sonographer. 

I then went to see the ENT who organised another ultrasound with a radiologist he trusted.  The right nodule was said to be smaller than 1cm, around 0.9, he didn't feel the margins were really irregular and he'd say it was a U2 nodule, but scan again in 6 months to be safe. This was in May 2023.

End of September 2023, I went to a one stop clinic and had another radiologist ultrasound and my larynx looked at.  I was told at the time they weren't worried, they don't perform biopsy or FNA on ones of this size, and to get a follow-up in a year. Larynx and voice box health,   no lympth nodes enlarged, no microcalcifications,  but didn't get much more info.

It's been about a year now and I'm freaking out now purely because of health anxiety.  I've managed to get myself a throat infection and the repeat scan is next week and worried this could skew my results.

I know majority of nodules are benign and the fact the radiologists and thyroid ENT weren't concerned should be reassurance enough, but the thought of cancer just makes me terrified.  I just started a new job and I'm worried about my bills if I ended up needing surgery and iodine treatment. 

I am confused as on many forums people end up with FNA even if they appear fine on imagery, but I was given a follow-up scan instead. Maybe I'm experiencing survivorship bias as people who had benign nodules are less likely to talk about it on the internet?

Do microcalcifications grow in 1 year if it's malignant? Would the throat infection turn up anything different?

Are thyroid CTs useful? Should I get one?,"Hey y’all! I’m trying to figure out if it is worth it to do a thyroid CT (well technically it’s a “chest CT”). My situation is a little odd, so let me explain:

- I went to a reproductive immunologist for a work-up, and part of that work-up included a thyroid US. I was told at that appointment that I had a complex “lesion” on my thyroid measuring 1.2 cm. This report stated the nodule was TR5.

- My ENT doctor (who I see for sinus issues) asked me to get another US done at my in-network healthcare provider, so I did. That report was similar, but the radiologist said it was TR4 (not TR5), said get a repeat scan in a year, and also asked for clinical correlation with parathyroid adenoma due to the location of the nodule. When I showed these images (and the images from my first US) to my ENT, he did not seem concerned in the least by what he saw, said “get a scan in 6 months”, but at my insistence not to wait that long (I’m trying to get pregnant), said we could do a biopsy.

- Did a nuclear medicine parathyroid scan to rule out parathyroid issues; that came back clear

- I scheduled a US-guided FNA biopsy of the nodule. Before they did the actual biopsy, they did a US first, and then the radiologist came in and told me she wasn’t even SURE that it was a nodule due to its location (she suspected it was BEHIND the thyroid and not on it). She said it looked like a regular lymph node and that we could do the biopsy anyway if I wanted, but that if it was indeed a lymph node, we probably would not get a result from the biopsy because the needles used for nodules are smaller than what they would typically use for a lymph node, and we are operating under the assumption that this is a nodule. She also did not seem too concerned.

- Biopsy result came back almost exactly the way the radiologist said it would, as “Unsatisfactory for evaluation”. Had follow-up with ENT today who just told me to go back in 2 months for a follow up US. I asked if there was any other imaging we food do that would help us figure out if it’s a nodule or a lymph node, and ent said we could do a CT with contrast.

But I don’t want to do a CT with contrast unless it’s going to give us the info we need to figure out once and for all if this is a nodule, or a lymph node. What do yall think? Should I do the CT? Is there some other test I can do to finally get the answer to this question ?

Weird trends to thyroid,"After I had my daughter in 2022 I had a brief-mild hyperthyroid state that resolved after a few months.

Highly suspicious thyroid nodule disappeared? ,"Hi everyone! 

I've been experiencing thyroid related health issues for the last two years. And really want to hear from other people to make sure I don't sound crazy. 

Two years ago, I completely lost my voice for over a week and had an odd pain in my neck/ throat. After multiple doctor visits, tests and meeting with an ENT. They tried to convince me I had GERD. When I got an ultrasound done they noted a nodule. Over time my symptoms began to worsen and my energy levels were completely depleted (I thought I was going through a depression). We monitored the nodule for the last 2 years, where it grew from 0.4cm to 0.7cm. From the notes they graded my nodule as a TR5 and highly suspisous. Until February, they said it was shrinking, which was odd to me as my symptoms were still worsening and my neck was swelling immensely, to the point where people could see it and i was experiencing discomfort swallowing. 

Fast forward to today. The doctor just called me to say that the nodule is no longer there. Which is wonderful news! But I'm worried this isn't true because I'm still experiencing all the pain and issues and the ultrasound tech noted technical difficulties.

Is it possible to have a highly suspicious go from 0.8cm to completely gone in less than 7 months?

Thyroid Cancer - Thyroidectomy Tips/Recovery,"Hi Everyone,

I am getting a total thyroidectomy on December 20th because they found a nodule that is cancerous. My lymph node mapping seemed clear. I am a 29 year old female and getting this done at Columbia in the city. I am extremely anxious because I feel my doctor said I would be fine and It would be an easy surgery however, I am reading a lot of posts that state differently. I am just looking for some feedback on what to expect afterwards, if there are any recovery tips such as things I can buy to prepare. I also have degenerative disc issues in my cervical spine/ neck and have been working so hard on correcting this. I am so afraid the thyroidectomy will set me back. I plan on telling the surgeon and nurses day of about positioning for my neck since I do experience pain and numbness/tingling at times. Any tips/help/ positive stories would be so helpful. Thank you all in advance!! ",1.0,[],,,,fear,"Engage in relaxation techniques, talk to a counselor, and avoid stress triggers."
Low TSH on NP Thyroid,"I’m curious to know if anyone has had any issues with NP Thyroid. My T3 and T4 came back normal after being put on 60 mg of NP Thyroid a couple of months ago, but my TSH came back .20 in shouty red. The only side effects I am having is easy to sweat. I’m also on medication for heart palpitations for anxiety, so if I was having that side effect, I wouldn’t know. BP is normal. I have called the doctor and nobody has called me back yet 😔. You know how you get the results before you see the doctor? Now I’m a little worried. I also have health anxiety, which doesn’t help, so do I stop taking the medication or wait for the doctor to tell me?

Thyroid Cancer Possible Recurrence,"I had thyroid cancer four years ago (did not have RAI) and have had undetectable thyroglobulin ever since. I had a sonogram recently that showed a nodule growing where my thyroid used to be “some punctuate echogenic foci” and “suspicious for recurrent disease” as well as a level 4 lymph node with punctuate echogenic foci “suspicious for metastasis”. I have a doctor's appointment to review this but the results suggest an FNA biopsy of the nodule and lymph node. I'm not looking for medical advice, but generally speaking, what type of interventions occur in the event of a recurrence? Is it usually surgery? Any chance this isn't a recurrence after all?

Consistent mysterious thyroid issues/nodules didn’t show up on ultrasound?,"For the past year I’ve been in hell to be honest. I was doing good but basically, I get sick or a cold and I get intense neurological/psych symptoms plus neck swelling.

They felt some nodules on my thyroid but the scan I did months prior didn’t show any and I did a quick in doctors ultrasound they didn’t see any either.

Thyroid levels,"Hello, 

am 29M

T3 - 1.59 ng/mL  
T4 - 12.4  µg/dL  
TSH - 0.41923  µIU/ml --- I feel TSH levels are low recommended (0.4-4.05)

Has anyone tried treating their (Long Covid) fatigue with Thyroid meds?,"I've noticed that my free T4 is just above the ""low"" reading 0.8 and I have extreme fatigue, heaviness, and mild vertigo upon awakening that while slightly diminishing as the day progresses is with me day in day out! This has been going on for nearly 2 years and occurred around the time of a bronchial infection along with my second Covid infection. Out of a kind of educated desperation (I'm an R.N.)

Thyroid Hurts!,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been struggling with something and was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this. My thyroid area gets really sore when a shirt rubs against the front of my neck. 

I’ve had a thyroid ultrasound and a scope, and both came back normal. My endocrinologist also brushed me off when I brought it up, so I’m feeling a little stuck and frustrated.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? If so, did you ever figure out what was causing it? I’d love to hear your thoughts or advice—anything helps at this point!

Thanks in advance. ",2.0,[],,,,anger,"Practice deep breathing, mindfulness, and physical activities to release tension."
Do I have hyper or hypo thyroidism? ,"Hi guys, I’ve had hypothyroidism since I was 12. It took me a long time to do research and understand what it is, but to be honest I still don’t understand everything. I go for a blood test every 6 months and get my synthroid dose adjusted as needed.

I’ve been working out more than I ever have in my life the last 2 years and haven’t lost a pound. If anything I’ve gained weight. Figured I’d get a full panel blood test and everything came back normal except 0.06 TSH, dangerously low.

Thyroid nodules ultrasound results ,Can someone please help me interpret these results? The doctors have never explained it to me since they first found the nodules in 2019. They always just said they were stable and too small to biopsy. I'm the one that always has to remind my PCP to get it rechecked. The last ultrasound I had showed one of them grew so they referred me for a biopsy stat but I have to wait till Dec 3 for my appointment. They also will not run a full this bloodwork panel because the one test always comes back normal. My symptoms are constant clearing my throat and dry coughing and hoarse weak voice and also occasional aching in my neck. I'm 42 F and a single mom so I'm looking for reassurance and help understanding these results.

Nothing is easy about the Thyroid ,I had my left thyroid removed August 12. Amazing surgery they did absolutely amazing work. Were able to keep my right side. I have felt incredible better than I have in years. The last 2 weeks that has started changing and feeling back to the way I did before (but I can breath now so that is a bonus) got my 8 week labs and my TSH is 5.484. Since i never have had a bad thyroid test in the past I don’t even know what this means beyond being high.

Did my thyroid make me become a morning person?,"Maybe a weird question, but I know that both hyper and hypo thyroid issues can mess with sleep. My labs are normal, but I've got a large nodule that we are keeping an eye on.

Overall I think I sleep ok, but since sometime in the last 10-12mo, I've unexpectedly shifted from being a moderate night owl (sleeping at 12-1am, walking up between 7 and 9 am depending on when/if I had to be at work) to a morning person (being very sleepy after 9 and usually sleeping by 10/10:30, waking up between 5 and 6:30 am. 

I also discovered a 4cm thyroid nodule this spring (which is why I had my levels tested). Ultrasound, FNA, met with specialists, etc. We've elected not to remove the nodule for now, but I'm curious if a shift in thyroid hormones might be a contributing to my sleep shift even if they are still in normal range? 

(Side note, I changed jobs this spring to a more stressful role, which could contribute, but my sleep shift started before the job shift)",2.0,[],,,,neutral,"Maintain a balanced lifestyle with regular exercise, sleep, and a healthy diet."
Thyroid nodule growing quickly,"Has anyone had a nodule grow quickly?? About a month ago, my neck started feeling slightly bruised and it felt like it got worked every day. After a few weeks, it got to the point where it’s hard to swallow and hard to turn my head so I made an appointment with my doctor and she sent me to the lab to have my thyroid checked with an ultrasound. They did find a solid lump that they labeled as TR4 so they referred me to endocrinology and I got an appointment 5 days later. My endocrinologist did another ultrasound and told me that the lump had grown significantly in five days. She did a biopsy but I haven’t heard back yet. My neck has been throbbing randomly and I’m guessing that’s from it growing but not sure. I’m wondering if anyone else has had a nodule grow so quickly and what was your experience after that??",4.0,[],,,,surprise,Channel your surprise into curiosity and learning new things.
